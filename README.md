# **About Me**
Always aiming to learn new things in my life, I am passionate about developing in DevSecOps. One of those people who are fascinated by the world that the internet and the digital world is taking us to. I got my first education in Information Security and Systems and started my career, then I worked for a while. I am a determined and patient rubberneck and at the same time meticulous and ambitious in my work!

          My Journey
          
Even though I was in a pretty stable financial situation right after the pandemic, I decided to pursue a new adventure. My plan was actually to apply my previous knowledge of Information Security and Systems to its relationship with Cloud technology. Then I suddenly found myself bein in cloud tech.

# **Projects**
Not all my projects are available on GitHub. Coming soon you can view my top projects/contributions or check out my repositories to see what I've been up to. Everything I build is open-source, and you are free to fork the repository and play around with the code. If you ever discover a bug or want to request a feature, feel free to submit issues or pull requests — they are always welcome!
