# **About Me**
I am a software developer based in Germany. I primarily work in JavaScript, though I am willing to learn other languages if needed. For the library, I use React.js. Aside from my software journey, I enjoy reading a book. I am quite passionate about community building, helping out in multiple communities while also maintaining my own.

          My Journey
          
Even though I was in a pretty stable financial situation right after the pandemic, I decided to pursue a new adventure. My plan was actually to apply my previous knowledge of Information Security and Systems to its relationship with Web Development. Then I suddenly found myself writing code. I searched up "learn to code for free" and came across freeCodeCamp, where I signed up and started the curriculum. While this was just intended to be a hobby, and I was considering a career in human resources, I ended up diving in full force. Within about 6 months I had completed the entire freeCodeCamp curriculum. Finding a strong love for this work, I continued to branch out. freeCodeCamp had taught me the basics of the MERN stack. I fell in love, and now use JavaScript on all of my projects.

# **Projects**
Not all my projects are available on GitHub. Coming soon you can view my top projects/contributions or check out my repositories to see what I've been up to. Everything I build is open-source, and you are free to fork the repository and play around with the code. If you ever discover a bug or want to request a feature, feel free to submit issues or pull requests â€” they are always welcome!
